# Hammurabi-lab
My first finished app on C++

#### Task
"You are invited to develop a clone of the game Hammurabi - Ruler of Egypt.
The game should be a console application
that performs input/output using <iostream>. The game should give
the user the opportunity to interrupt (exit the game) at the beginning of each
round and automatically save the progress to a file. When
restarting the game, if there is saved progress, the game should ask
whether to continue the previous game or start the game again. To work
with files, use the <fstream> library."
